# JTR-Workshop: Operation Hash Breaker

Welcome, Analyst! This is the official repository for the **"John The Ripper: Hands-On Workshop"** hosted by the **Cloud and Cybersecurity Club**.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate through a series of challenges designed to test your password-cracking skills. You will use the legendary John the Ripper tool to uncover hidden flags.

## üöÄ How to Begin

1.  Navigate to the first level's folder to receive your initial briefing.
2.  Each level has its own `README.md` file that contains the details of the challenge.
3.  Analyze the hashes, choose your wordlists, and apply your techniques to crack the passwords and find the flags.

## üìú Rules of Engagement

* Read the `README.md` in each level's directory carefully.
* The flag is the password you successfully crack.
* You have **only one chance** to submit your answers via the Google Form, so double-check your findings before submission.

## üèÅ Flag Submission Form

Once you have collected all the flags, submit them through the official form to log your score.
