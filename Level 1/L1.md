# Challenge 1: Keys to the Kingdom

Welcome, Analyst - but not everyone is happy with your arrival. 

Our adversary has grown wary. Theyâ€™ve locked the door with something very elegant.

An SSH private key has been intercepted, but it's useless in its current state, protected by a passphrase the enemy believes is unbreakable. They think this will slow us down.

Break into the SSH private key file - one of the most popular forms of authentication in real-world systems.

***HINT**: Remember the steps carefully.
