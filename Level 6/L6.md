## Challenge 6: The Network Packet

 Time to move beyond simple hashes. We've captured some network traffic in the *traffic.pcap* file. Inside, we believe there's a Kerberos authentication ticket. John can't read .pcap files directly. First, you must use a helper script to convert the network data into a format John understands. Then, you can crack it like any other hash.

**Challenge File**: traffic.pcap

**HINT** : When stuck > google
