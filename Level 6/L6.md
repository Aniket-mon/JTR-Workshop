## Challenge 6: The Locked Archive

Analyst, our field team has recovered a password-protected archive from a target's machine. We believe it contains sensitive intel, but it's locked down. Yes, you read that right. We can use John to crack the password on password-protected Zip files!

### How-To: Cracking Zip Files
John can't work on the .zip file directly. Use a separate tool from the John suite, zip2john, to convert the Zip file into a hash format that John will understand.

1. Convert the Zip to a Hash

The primary usage is to redirect the output of the tool into a new file:

zip2john [zip file] > [output file]

Example:  ```zip2john file.zip > hash.txt```

2. Crack the Hash

You can then take the new file, hash.txt, and feed it directly into John using the syntax you're already familiar with.


### Your Mission:

Find the password and secure the flag!
