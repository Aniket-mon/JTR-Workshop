## Challenge 5: The Autopsy

This challenge is not a password hunt; it's a digital autopsy.

A critical inventory management server suffered a catastrophic failure.  We have only one artifact from the scene: a single, corrupted file pulled from the database.core.dump.

The developer's "dead man's switch" protocol means the password is a phrase describing the fatal transaction. You must assemble this "dying declaration" from across the database's multiple lists.

**HINT** :
Each list is a potential list of clues. Only one shall lead you.
