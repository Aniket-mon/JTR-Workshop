## Challenge 3: The Unshadowing

Analyst, we've recovered two critical files from a Linux server's file system. The user's password hash is in the shadow file, but John needs information from both to crack it. Your mission is to combine these files into a format John understands and then extract the password for the user agent47.

**Hint**: We believe a utility that comes with John can help you unshadow the files.

Challenge Files:

1. passwd_level3.txt

2. shadow_level3.txt
