## Challenge 4: The Honeypot

You've infiltrated a decoy server set up by our target and recovered a single log file: system_events.log. Intel suggests the file contains the hash of an operative's true callsign.

However, our target is clever. They've laid a trapâ€”a digital honeypot designed to lure you in, waste your time, and lead you to a dead end. Your mission is to identify the trap, discard the false lead, and uncover the real hash hidden in plain sight.

Challenge File : system_events.log

**HINT**: Take your time. Choose wisely

Use ``` echo "hash" > hash4.txt``` to create a text file containing the hash
