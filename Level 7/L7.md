## Challenge 7: The Endgame

Excellent work, Analyst. You've navigated the traps, sifted through the wreckage, and proven your skill. But there was never a series of separate challenges. It was all one system, one long test designed by a single, elusive mastermind we call "The Architect."

Each challenge was a gate in their security labyrinth, designed to test a different skill. Every password you uncovered was not just a key, but a breadcrumbâ€”a fragment of a larger protocol.

The Architect believed no one could pass all their gates. But in the end they were wrong.

The password is a "failsafe key" constructed from your journey. You can only succeed if you have conquered and recorded every key until now.

**The flag is in the form of** : flag1_flag2_flag3 .......... (follow the pattern and exclude Level 8)

                        tick tock tick tock (no need to crack anything this time)
