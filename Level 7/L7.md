## Challenge 7: The Final Flag

 Excellent work, Analyst. But there's one final secret. The threat group has hidden a final passphrase by combining parts of the previous passwords you've uncovered. Review your notes, piece together the fragments, and find the final flag to complete your mission.

 You can only finish this mission if you conquered all the keys until now.

**HINT** : Follow the pattern flag1_flag2_flag3 ..........
